# Large Dataset of Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

OCT is a dataset for classification task.

A model trained on Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images can have several potential functionalities, primarily focused on ophthalmic diagnostics and research:

1. Disease Classification
- Diabetic Retinopathy (DR): Models can classify stages of DR, helping in early detection and management.
- Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD): Detection and staging of AMD to monitor disease progression.
- Glaucoma: Identification of glaucomatous optic neuropathy to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning.
- Other Retinopathies: Classification of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), epiretinal membrane (ERM), and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

2. Image Quality Assessment
- Models can evaluate the quality of OCT images, distinguishing between high and low-quality scans. This is crucial for ensuring that only reliable images are used for clinical decisions.

3. Retinal Biomarker Detection
- Automatic detection and quantification of retinal biomarkers, such as drusen or retinal layer thickness, which are important for diagnosing and monitoring retinal diseases.

4. Segmentation and Quantification
- Segmentation of retinal layers and features to provide precise measurements, aiding in disease diagnosis and progression monitoring.
- Quantification of vascular changes in OCT angiography (OCTA) images to assess retinal health.

5. Predictive Analytics
- Models can predict disease progression and treatment response based on longitudinal OCT data, helping in personalized medicine approaches[3].

6. Referral Triage
- Automated systems can prioritize patients based on the severity of their retinal conditions, optimizing clinical workflows and ensuring timely interventions[3].

These functionalities leverage deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze OCT images and support clinical decision-making in ophthalmology.
